    "# Create Text Embeddings for a Vector Store using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through building a question/answer system that retrieves information from a private knowledge base. A pre-trained LLM, or likely even a fine-tuned LLM will not be sufficient (in and of itself) when you want a conversational interface to ask specific questions about specific data (private knowledge base). This private knowledge base can be a collection of documents, websites, research papers, or even structured data tables and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to setup the private knowledge base are as follows:\n",
    "1) Split documents into chunks\n",
    "2) Vectorize (embed) each chunk \n",
    "3) Store vectors/embeddings in a database\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a vectorstore of embeddings (private knowledge-base), the process of using it in a conversational workflow are as follows:\n",
    "1) Embed the query (question)\n",
    "2) Nearest neighbors lookup with query in vectorstore to find relevant chunks\n",
    "3) Use relevant chunks to formulate response  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of course requires an LLM (like PaLM or others) to formulate responses to queries with the relevant chunks found via nearest neighbors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many options for a vectorstore, including managed and scalable offerings like [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview). Additionally there are different options for LLMs to use as the underpinning language model. In this walkthrough we will use [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) as a vectorstore and [PaLM](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart) as the underpinning language model. In a production environment, consider using a more scalable and efficient vector store such as Vertex AI Vector Search. \n"

The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.\\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\\nBy the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on mod', metadata={'title': 'Machine learning', 'summary': \"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

    "Now that we have the documents we will split them into chunks. Each chunk will become one vector in the vector store. To do this we will define a chunk size (number of characters) and a chunk overlap (amount of overlap i.e. sliding window). The perfect chunk size can be difficult to determine. Too large of a chunk size leads to too much information per chunk (individual chunks not specific enough), however too small of a chunk size leads to not enough information per chunk. In both cases, nearest neighbors lookup with a query/question embedding may struggle to retrieve the actually relevant chunks, or fail altogether if the chunks are too large to use as context with an LLM query.\n",

Note: you can specify a custom `length_function` with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` if you want chunk size/overlap to be determined by something other than Python's `len` function. In addition to `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, there are [other text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/split_by_token) you can consider.
